# etherscan_scraper v1 by @0xriptide

Manually save the file from https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified?filter=solc as 'contracts.html'

Add your etherscan API key. Rate limiting is built into the script.

Script will read saved html file and extract contract addresses to 'contract_list.txt' then pull all contracts and export to individual .sol files
